## Strategy
The strategy design pattern uses classes to make reccuring things more efficient 
by providing an object that can be reused. 

### Implementation
We have applied the strategy design pattern for fuel and speed, as these variables 
have a certain type that is always reccuring. We are using interfaces to generate
 the different kinds of classes depending on what type is desired. We did not apply it for the name,
luggage cappacity and price as these variables change possibly with every
new car and the design pattern would require a new class for every new value
which would not make sense. 

## Testing
We have only two methods of interest in this project. ride() in Customer and 
getRideInformation() in vehicle, which  is only made for better cohesion. 
We therefore tested ride() using a customer with two different vehicles, checking
if the print is correct, and also once using an invalid vehicle null. 

## Javadoc
We autogenerated Javadoc in intellij but were careful to annotate all methods
of interest (therefore excluding most getters and setters).

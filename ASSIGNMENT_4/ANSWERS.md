## Interface
We added an interface People in our Code. The idea was that every 'human' must have a name, a surname and an id. 
So all classes except of the CreditCard Class must use the getter methodes which are in People. 
There is also a list of all IDs, which were created. 
With this list we can guarantee that no ID will be created which already exists. 

## Abstract Class
We created an abstract Class Employees. 
This class has all attributes which an employee must have (including the customer list).
This list contains all customers which the employee is allowed to serve.
All employees can have multiple customers.
For this reason there is a (*) in the UML Diagram.
The class has also the methods checkInputEmployee() and upgradeRegularToGold().
Every employee can upgrade a customer from regular to gold and for this reason every emplyee will inherit this method. 
The checkInputEmployee method checks only if the ID is already used. 
It takes this information from the People interface. 
Regular_Employee, Section_Chief and Main_Chief inherit from the Employee abstract class. 


## Testing and Javadoc
We created careful tests for all methods and eventualities we could think of.
The tests are documented in form of Javadoc in the folder Javadoctest.
The methods in the src have a javadoc description and tags for parameter and return.
the tests have only a javadoc description as they are all void and do not take parameters. 
Only tests that do not test getters and setters have a javadeoc description. 

## Solutions
Please find the code in folder src, testing in folder test, the diagram is labeled UML.pdf and the javadoc as mentioned in the javadoctest folder.
